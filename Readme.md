## OBJECTIVES:
Built a e-commerce platform with user authentication,product listings, and a shopping cart. Used React  for the frontend and Express.js  for the backend.Implemented user authentication and authorization. Created product listings and a payment gateway.

##  Frontend Implementation 
The frontend is built using **React.js**, using React features such as hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and state management using **Redux**. It includes components and routing to create an interactive user experience.

## Backend Implementation 
The backend of this e-commerce website is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, connecting to **MongoDB Atlas** for database management. It implements API endpoints to handle various functionalities such as product management, user management, and order processing.

### Key Activities:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Employs functional components and hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to handle state and side effects, enhancing code reusability and simplicity.
2. **Global State Management with Redux**: Controls the applicationâ€™s global state, including user authentication, product listings, and the shopping cart. Redux Thunk is utilized for handling asynchronous actions.
3. **Dynamic Routing via React Router**: Enables navigation throughout the application, managing routes for product pages, user authentication, and the shopping cart seamlessly.
4. **Local State and Side Effects**: Utilizes `useState` for managing local state and `useEffect` for handling side effects, ensuring components efficiently update based on changes in state.
5. **Async Operations with Redux Thunk**: Manages asynchronous tasks such as API calls and data fetching from the backend using Redux Thunk.

### Technologies Used:
#### **MERN Stack:**
**MongoDB:** Efficient and scalable NoSQL database, ensuring robust data storage and retrieval capabilities.  
**Express.js:** Fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, facilitating the creation of powerful APIs and web applications.  
**React.js:** Dynamic and responsive JavaScript library for building modern and engaging user interfaces, utilizing:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;**useState:** React hook for managing state in functional components, enhancing component interactivity and reactivity.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;**useContext:** React hook for accessing and consuming context values across components, facilitating efficient data sharing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;**useReducer:** React hook for managing complex state logic with reducer functions, offering a more organized approach to state management.  
**Node.js:** Lightweight and efficient JavaScript runtime environment, enabling scalable and high-performance server-side execution.
